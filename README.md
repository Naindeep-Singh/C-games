# C Games: Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4

Welcome to the C Games repository! This repository contains two classic games implemented in C: Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. Both games are implemented in a simple text-based format.

## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Connect 4

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

### How to Play

To play any game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `<game>.c` file using a C compiler.
   ```bash
   gcc <game>.c -o connect4
   ```
2. Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash

   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
